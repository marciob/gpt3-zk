Examples

Q: What is UniRep?
A: UniRep, short for Universal Reputation, is a protocol that enables the creation of a decentralized reputation system on the Ethereum blockchain. It aims to provide a standard for reputation systems that can be used by various applications, platforms and communities. The protocol allows users to earn reputation while maintaining their privacy by using zero-knowledge proofs. The reputation system is built on a system of temporary identities called epoch keys, which are linked to a user's reputation and change regularly to preserve anonymity. Each community can decide how the reputation would be used, how many users would be used, how users would be onboarded, how users would interact with each other and what it takes to receive a positive or negative reputation.

Q: What is the role of attesters in UniRep protocol?
A: Attesters in UniRep protocol are the platforms, businesses, and communities that provide reputation in the UniRep ecosystem. They act as world builders and community managers, and have great flexibility in what to build and how to use the reputation system. They decide how many user identities are used, how users are onboarded, and how users interact with each other. Most importantly, attesters decide why someone receives a positive reputation and why someone receives a negative reputation. They use publicly known Ethereum addresses while user identities are always kept private. They also set the length of epochs, which is the time during which reputation is accumulated and carried over.
